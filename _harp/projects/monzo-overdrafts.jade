          h1 Monzo ‚Äî Overdrafts overhaul
          p.subtitle.text-lg
            | Monzo is a leading UK challenger bank, with an overdraft our customers know as transparent and easy to understand. We were faced with a challenge - due to new regulation, we had to change the fundamental overdraft offering at Monzo, and move our customers to a new model - while balancing business needs and making sure our customers still received a great product.

  h3.blue.block-ver-md The problem
  .container-sm.text-left
    p.text-md.block-ver-md 
      | The FCA (Financial conduct authority) implemented new rules for overdrafts to make it easier to compare rates between all UK banks and to make overdraft charges fairer on the customer.
      | In simplest terms, we had to change our pricing model from an easy to understand fixed fee of 50p a day, to a more complicated interest based model (% APR), this required massive changes to our product and preperation for our customers who relied on their overdraft.

    h3.blue.block-ver-md The goals
    .container-sm.text-left
      p.text-md.block-ver-md Overdraft charges are already anxiety causing for some customers, keeping this in mind we needed to make sure:
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | That our customers had 
        b.bold enough warning 
        | about the change, so they could turn off their overdraft if they didn't agree with the new pricing, and also so we were compliant with the new rules
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | That we balanced our messaging and execution so that users could 
        b.bold clearly understand the new charges, 
        | showcasing that it could be better or worse for you depending how you use your overdraft
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | Being 
        b.bold transparent 
        | over fees
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | Lettings customers know we 
        b.bold now have higher limits 
        | to cater for customers who may need to borrow more on the new pricing
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | An understandable solution that did 
        b.bold not increase 
        |  customer queries or lose customers who needed their overdraft

    h3.blue.block-ver-md First prototypes and experiments
    p.page-subtitle 
      | We launched various experiments to see which entry points performed the best,
      | which flows had the least drop off so that customers were able to get all 
      | the information they needed while also having the option to migrate to the new pricing if they wanted. 
      | We also did some concept testing with staff initially as we couldn't publicly announce the new APR % pricing yet
