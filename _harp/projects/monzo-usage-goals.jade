          h1 Monzo — Helping people user their overdrafts less
          p.subtitle.text-lg
            | On the back of a vision piece I had written to determine the future of overdrafts at Monzo, I conducted a design sprint to kick off what this would look like. We came up with a solution to help our customers slowly get out of their overdraft, something that would be incredibly useful for customers in need of financial help.

  h3.blue.block-ver-md The problem
  .container-sm.text-left
    p.text-md.block-ver-md 
      | We had noticed a pattern that our customers were currently self managing their overdraft use by changing their limit, this wasn't ideal for them and would sometimes lead to them losing the available credit they relied on. We needed to fix this and we wanted to work on something that was good for our customers, something that we'd seen in research and from talking to them that they would benefit from.

    .container-sm.text-left
      p.text-md.block-ver-md Our mission statement for our design sprint was:
      
      p.text-lg.block-ver-md.blue “Monzo overdrafts don't make me feel anxious and I feel in control of my finances, confident in using it, transparent while i'm using it, and it helps me manage it down.”
      
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | That we balanced our messaging and execution so that users could 
        b.bold clearly understand the new charges, 
        | showcasing that it could be better or worse for you depending how you use your overdraft
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | Being 
        b.bold transparent 
        | over fees
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | Lettings customers know we 
        b.bold now have higher limits 
        | to cater for customers who may need to borrow more on the new pricing
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | An understandable solution that did 
        b.bold not increase 
        |  customer queries or lose customers who needed their overdraft

      | We also did some concept testing with staff initially as we couldn't publicly announce the new APR % pricing yet
