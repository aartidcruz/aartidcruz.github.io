          h1 Monzo ‚Äî Helping people user their overdrafts less
          p.subtitle.text-lg
            | On the back of a vision piece I had written to determine the future of overdrafts at Monzo, I conducted a design sprint to kick off what this would look like. We came up with a solution to help our customers slowly get out of their overdraft, something that would be incredibly useful for customers in need of financial help.

  h3.blue.block-ver-md The problem
  .container-sm.text-left
    p.text-md.block-ver-md 
      | We had noticed a pattern that our customers were currently self managing their overdraft use by changing their limit, this wasn't ideal for them and would sometimes lead to them losing the available credit they relied on. We needed to fix this and we wanted to work on something that was good for our customers, something that we'd seen in research and from talking to them that they would benefit from.

    h3.blue.block-ver-md The goals
    .container-sm.text-left
      p.text-md.block-ver-md Overdraft charges are already anxiety causing for some customers, keeping this in mind we needed to make sure:
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | That our customers had 
        b.bold enough warning 
        | about the change, so they could turn off their overdraft if they didn't agree with the new pricing, and also so we were compliant with the new rules
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | That we balanced our messaging and execution so that users could 
        b.bold clearly understand the new charges, 
        | showcasing that it could be better or worse for you depending how you use your overdraft
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | Being 
        b.bold transparent 
        | over fees
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | Lettings customers know we 
        b.bold now have higher limits 
        | to cater for customers who may need to borrow more on the new pricing
      p.text-md.block-ver-md.breaker-point 
        | An understandable solution that did 
        b.bold not increase 
        |  customer queries or lose customers who needed their overdraft

    p.page-subtitle 
      | We launched various experiments to see which entry points performed the best,
      | which flows had the least drop off so that customers were able to get all 
      | the information they needed while also having the option to migrate to the new pricing if they wanted. 
      | We also did some concept testing with staff initially as we couldn't publicly announce the new APR % pricing yet
