          h1 Monzo ‚Äî Helping people user their overdrafts less
          p.subtitle.text-lg
            | On the back of a vision piece I had written to determine the future of overdrafts at Monzo, I conducted a design sprint to kick off what this would look like. We came up with a solution to help our customers slowly get out of their overdraft, something that would be incredibly useful for customers in need of financial help.

  .container-sm.text-left
    p.text-md.block-ver-md 
      | We had noticed a pattern that our customers were currently self managing their overdraft use by changing their limit, this wasn't ideal for them and would sometimes lead to them losing the available credit they relied on. We needed to fix this and we wanted to work on something that was good for our customers, something that we'd seen in research and from talking to them that they would benefit from.

        | customer operations, data, and product to form our solution, did rapid sketching, and a final storyboard to shape our solution

      p.text-lg.block-ver-md.blue Monzo overdrafts don't make me feel anxious and I feel in control of my finances, confident in using it, transparent while i'm using it, and it helps me manage it down
