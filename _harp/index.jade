            | I genuinley love bringing motion into my process to ensure I'm thinking about the whole picture
            | and being a fairly straightfoward person, you won't ever find me speaking in jargon-y design terms.
            | I'll bring the whole squad into design decisions (queue warm fuzzy feelings ‚ù§Ô∏è)
