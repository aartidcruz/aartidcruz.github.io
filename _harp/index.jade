            | as a Designer and Dev on the UK launch team. With my 5 years of experience -
            | I’ve had the opportunity to learn how to create beautiful and practical experiences,
            | with design and languages such as stylus, pug, and react. 
            | I also enjoy working with animation and am super interested in making interactive projects!
            | In my spare time, I create music and watch terrible 
            | tv shows on netflix like a regular human.
