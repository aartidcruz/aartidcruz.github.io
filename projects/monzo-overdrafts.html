We were faced with a challenge - due to new regulation, we had to change the fundamental overdraft offering at Monzo, and move our customers to a new model - while balancing business needs and making sure our customers still received a great product.</p><p class="breaker">Product design lead</p><p class="breaker">Motion</p><p class="breaker">Research</p></div></div></div></div><div class="biggy-image monzo-1"></div><div class="block-ver-xl"></div><h3 class="blue block-ver-md">The problem</h3><div class="container-sm text-left"><p class="text-md block-ver-md"> 
The FCA (Financial conduct authority) implemented new rules for overdrafts to make it easier to compare rates between all UK banks and to make overdraft charges fairer on the customer.
In simplest terms, we had to change our pricing model from an easy to understand fixed fee of 50p a day, to a more complicated interest based model (% APR), this required massive changes to our product and preperation for our customers who relied on their overdraft.</p></div><div class="block-xl"><h3 class="blue block-ver-md">The goals</h3><div class="container-sm text-left"><p class="text-md block-ver-md">Overdraft charges are already anxiety causing for some customers, keeping this in mind we needed to make sure:</p><p class="text-md block-ver-md breaker-point"> 
That our customers had <b class="bold">enough warning </b>about the change, so they could turn off their overdraft if they didn't agree with the new pricing, and also so we were compliant with the new rules</p><p class="text-md block-ver-md breaker-point"> 
That we balanced our messaging and execution so that users could <b class="bold">clearly understand the new charges, </b>showcasing that it could be better or worse for you depending how you use your overdraft</p><p class="text-md block-ver-md breaker-point"> 
Being <b class="bold">transparent </b>over fees</p><p class="text-md block-ver-md breaker-point"> 
Lettings customers know we <b class="bold">now have higher limits </b>to cater for customers who may need to borrow more on the new pricing</p><p class="text-md block-ver-md breaker-point">

We launched various experiments to see which entry points performed the best,
which flows had the least drop off so that customers were able to get all
