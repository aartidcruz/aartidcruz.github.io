      p I’m a UI/UX designer and front end developer who lives in Sydney. With 2 years under my belt at
      a(href="http://www.creativelicencedigital.com/", target="_blank") Creative Licence Digital
      | , I’ve had the opportunity to learn how to create beautiful and practical interfaces, as well as learning to code with radtastic languages such as sass, jade and js. I also enjoy illustration, and animation! In my spare time, I play guitar and watch terrible tv shows on netflix like a regular person.
