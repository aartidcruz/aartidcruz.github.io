      p I’m a UI/UX designer and front end developer who lives in Sydney. With 2 years under my belt at tCreative Licence Digital, I’ve had the opportunity to learn how to create beautiful and practical interfaces, as well as learning to code with radtastic languages such as sass, jade and js. I also enjoy illustration, and animation! In my spare time, I play guitar and watch terrible tv shows on netflix like a regular person.
